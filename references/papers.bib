   abstract = {<p><![CDATA[Abstract. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models solve a system of partial differential equations based on physical laws to forecast the future state of the atmosphere. These models are deployed operationally, but they are computationally very expensive. Recently, the potential of deep neural networks to generate bespoke weather forecasts has been explored in a couple of scientific studies inspired by the success of video frame prediction models in computer vision. In this study, a simple recurrent neural network with convolutional filters, called ConvLSTM, and an advanced generative network, the Stochastic Adversarial Video Prediction (SAVP) model, are applied to create hourly forecasts of the 2 m temperature for the next 12 h over Europe. We make use of 13 years of data from the ERA5 reanalysis, of which 11 years are utilized for training and 1 year each is used for validating and testing. We choose the 2 m temperature, total cloud cover, and the 850 hPa temperature as predictors and show that both models attain predictive skill by outperforming persistence forecasts. SAVP is superior to ConvLSTM in terms of several evaluation metrics, confirming previous results from computer vision that larger, more complex networks are better suited to learn complex features and to generate better predictions. The 12 h forecasts of SAVP attain a mean squared error (MSE) of about 2.3 K2, an anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) larger than 0.85, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of around 0.72, and a gradient ratio (rG) of about 0.82. The ConvLSTM yields a higher MSE (3.6 K2), a smaller ACC (0.80) and SSIM (0.65), and a slightly larger rG (0.84). The superior performance of SAVP in terms of MSE, ACC, and SSIM can be largely attributed to the generator. A sensitivity study shows that a larger weight of the generative adversarial network (GAN) component in the SAVP loss leads to even better preservation of spatial variability at the cost of a somewhat increased MSE (2.5 K2). Including the 850 hPa temperature as an additional predictor enhances the forecast quality, and the model also benefits from a larger spatial domain. By contrast, adding the total cloud cover as predictor or reducing the amount of training data to 8 years has only small effects. Although the temperature forecasts obtained in this way are still less powerful than contemporary NWP models, this study demonstrates that sophisticated deep neural networks may achieve considerable forecast quality beyond the nowcasting range in a purely data-driven way.]]></p>},

   abstract = {<p>Atmospheric air temperature is the most crucial metrological parameter. Despite its influence on multiple fields such as hydrology, the environment, irrigation, and agriculture, this parameter describes climate change and global warming quite well. Thus, accurate and timely air temperature forecasting is essential because it provides more important information that can be relied on for future planning. In this study, four Data-Driven Approaches, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree (RT), Quantile Regression Tree (QRT), ARIMA, Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), have been applied to forecast short-, and mid-term air temperature (daily, and weekly) over North America under continental climatic conditions. The time-series data is relatively long (2000 to 2021), 70% of the data are used for model calibration (2000 to 2015), and the rest are used for validation. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions have been used to select the best input combination for the forecasting models. The quality of predicting models is evaluated using several statistical measures and graphical comparisons. For daily scale, the SVR has generated more accurate estimates than other models, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 3.592°C), Correlation Coefficient (R = 0.964), Mean Absolute Error (MAE = 2.745°C), and Thiels’ U-statistics (U = 0.127). Besides, the study found that both RT and SVR performed very well in predicting weekly temperature. This study discovered that the duration of the employed data and its dispersion and volatility from month to month substantially influence the predictive models’ efficacy. Furthermore, the second scenario is conducted using the randomization method to divide the data into training and testing phases. The study found the performance of the models in the second scenario to be much better than the first one, indicating that climate change affects the temperature pattern of the studied station. The findings offered technical support for generating high-resolution daily and weekly temperature forecasts using Data-Driven Methodologies.</p>},

The most common topics of interest in the abstracts were identified, and some of them examined in detail: in numerical weather prediction research—photovoltaic and wind energy, atmospheric physics and processes; in climate research—parametrizations, extreme events, and climate change. With the created database, it was also possible to extract the most commonly examined meteorological fields (wind, precipitation, temperature, pressure, and radiation), methods (Deep Learning, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost), and countries (China, USA, Australia, India, and Germany) in these topics. Performing critical reviews of the literature, authors are trying to predict the future research direction of these fields, with the main conclusion being that machine learning methods will be a key feature in future weather forecasting.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Deep-learning (DL) postprocessing methods are examined to obtain reliable and accurate probabilistic forecasts from single-member numerical weather predictions of integrated vapor transport (IVT). Using a 34-yr reforecast, based on the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes West-WRF mesoscale model of North American West Coast IVT, the dynamically/statistically derived 0–120-h probabilistic forecasts for IVT under atmospheric river (AR) conditions are tested. These predictions are compared with the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) dynamic model and the GEFS calibrated with a neural network. In addition, the DL methods are tested against an established, but more rigid, statistical–dynamical ensemble method (the analog ensemble). The findings show, using continuous ranked probability skill score and Brier skill score as verification metrics, that the DL methods compete with or outperform the calibrated GEFS system at lead times from 0 to 48 h and again from 72 to 120 h for AR vapor transport events. In addition, the DL methods generate reliable and skillful probabilistic forecasts. The implications of varying the length of the training dataset are examined, and the results show that the DL methods learn relatively quickly and ∼10 years of hindcast data are required to compete with the GEFS ensemble.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Accurately predicting meteorological parameters such as air temperature and humidity plays a crucial role in air quality management. This study proposes different machine learning algorithms: Gradient Boosting Tree (G.B.T.), Random forest (R.F.), Linear regression (LR) and different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (multi-layered perceptron, radial basis function) for prediction of such as air temperature (T) and relative humidity (Rh). Daily data over 24 years for Kula Terengganu station were obtained from the Malaysia Meteorological Department. Results showed that MLP-NN performs well among the others in predicting daily T and Rh with R of 0.7132 and 0.633, respectively. However, in monthly prediction T also MLP-NN model provided closer standards deviation to actual value and can be used to predict monthly T with R 0.8462. Whereas in prediction monthly Rh, the RBF-NN model's efficiency was higher than other models with R of 0.7113. To validate the performance of the trained both artificial neural network (ANN) architectures MLP-NN and RBF-NN, both were applied to an unseen data set from observation data in the region. The results indicated that on either architecture of ANN, there is good potential to predict daily and monthly T and Rh values with an acceptable range of accuracy.</p>},
