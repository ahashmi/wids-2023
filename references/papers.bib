   abstract = {<p>Prediction of complex epidemiological systems such as COVID-19 is challenging on many grounds. Commonly used compartmental models struggle to handle an epidemiological process that evolves rapidly and is spatially heterogeneous. On the other hand, machine learning methods are limited at the beginning of the pandemics due to small data size for training. We propose a deep learning approach to predict future COVID-19 infection cases and deaths 1 to 4 weeks ahead at the fine granularity of US counties. The multi-variate Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is trained on multiple time series samples at the same time, including a mobility series. Results show that adding mobility as a variable and using multiple samples to train the network improve predictive performance both in terms of bias and of variance of the forecasts. We also show that the predicted results have similar accuracy and spatial patterns with a standard ensemble model used as benchmark. The model is attractive in many respects, including the fine geographic granularity of predictions and great predictive performance several weeks ahead. Furthermore, data requirement and computational intensity are reduced by substituting a single model to multiple models folded in an ensemble model.</p>},

   abstract = {Spatio-temporal (ST) data for urban applications, such as taxi demand, traffic flow, regional rainfall is inherently stochastic and unpredictable. Recently, deep learning based ST prediction models are proposed to learn the ST characteristics of data. However, it is still very challenging (1) to adequately learn the complex and non-linear ST relationships; (2) to model the high variations in the ST data volumes as it is inherently dynamic, changing over time (i.e., irregular) and highly influenced by many external factors, such as adverse weather, accidents, traffic control, PoI, etc.; and (3) as there can be many complicated external factors that can affect the accuracy and it is impossible to list them explicitly. To handle the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep generative adversarial network based model (named, D-GAN) for more accurate ST prediction by implicitly learning ST feature representations in an unsupervised manner. D-GAN adopts a GAN-based structure and jointly learns generation and variational inference of data. More specifically, D-GAN consists of two major parts: (1) a deep ST feature learning network to model the ST correlations and semantic variations, and underlying factors of variations and irregularity in the data through the implicit distribution modelling; (2) a fusion module to incorporate external factors for reaching a better inference. To the best our knowledge, no prior work studies ST prediction problem via deep implicit generative model and in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments performed on two real-world datasets show that D-GAN achieves more accurate results than traditional as well as deep learning based ST prediction methods.},

   abstract = {<p>Hydrological extremes occupy a large spatial extent, with a temporal sequence, both of which can be influenced by a range of climatological and geographical phenomena. Understanding the key information in the spatial and temporal domain is essential to make accurate forecasts. The capabilities of deep learning methods can be applied in such instances due to their enhanced ability in learning complex relationships. Given its success in other domains, this study presents a framework that features a long short-term memory deep learning model for spatio temporal hydrological extreme forecasting in the South Pacific region. The data consists of satellite rainfall estimates and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. We use the satellite rainfall estimate to calculate the effective drought index (EDI), an indicator of hydrological extreme events. The framework is developed to forecast monthly EDI using three different approaches: (i) univariate (ii) multivariate with neighbouring spatial points (iii) multivariate with neighbouring spatial points and the eigenvector values of SST. Additionally, better identification of extreme wet events is noted with the inclusion of the eigenvector values of SST. By establishing the framework for the multivariate approach in two forms, it is evident that the model accuracy is contingent on understanding the dominant feature which influences precipitation regimes in the Pacific. The framework can be used to better understand linear and non-linear relationships within multi-dimensional data in other study regions, and provide long-term climate outlooks.</p>},

However, there are few studies that investigate how informative features can be extracted from population activity electroneurographic (ENG) signals. In this study, five feature extraction frameworks were implemented on sensory ENG datasets and their classification performance was compared. The datasets were collected in acute rat experiments where multi-channel nerve cuffs recorded from the sciatic nerve in response to proprioceptive stimulation of the hindlimb. A novel feature extraction framework, which incorporates spatio-temporal focus and dynamic time warping, achieved classification accuracies above 90% while keeping a low computational cost. This framework outperformed the remaining frameworks tested in this study and has improved the discrimination accuracy of the sensory signals. Thus, this study has extended the tools available to extract features from sensory population activity ENG signals.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>As the role played by statistical and computational sciences in climate and environmental modelling and prediction becomes more important, Machine Learning researchers are becoming more aware of the relevance of their work to help tackle the climate crisis. Indeed, being universal nonlinear function approximation tools, Machine Learning algorithms are efficient in analysing and modelling spatially and temporally variable environmental data. While Deep Learning models have proved to be able to capture spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal dependencies through their automatic feature representation learning, the problem of the interpolation of continuous spatio-temporal fields measured on a set of irregular points in space is still under-investigated. To fill this gap, we introduce here a framework for spatio-temporal prediction of climate and environmental data using deep learning. Specifically, we show how spatio-temporal processes can be decomposed in terms of a sum of products of temporally referenced basis functions, and of stochastic spatial coefficients which can be spatially modelled and mapped on a regular grid, allowing the reconstruction of the complete spatio-temporal signal. Applications on two case studies based on simulated and real-world data will show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in modelling coherent spatio-temporal fields.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Decrease in air quality is one of the most crucial threats to human health. There is an imperative and necessary need for more accurate air quality prediction. To meet this need, we propose a novel long short-term memory-based deep random subspace learning (LSTM-DRSL) framework for air quality forecasting. Specifically, we incorporate real-time pollutant emission data into the model input. We also design a spatial-temporal analysis approach to make good use of these data. The prediction model is developed by combining random subspace learning with a deep learning algorithm in order to improve the prediction accuracy. Empirical analyses based on multiple datasets over China from January 2015 to September 2017 are performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework for hourly pollutant concentration prediction at an urban-agglomeration scale. The empirical results indicate that our framework is a viable method for air quality prediction. With consideration of the regional scale, the LSTM-DRSL framework performs better at a relatively large regional scale (around 200â300 km). In addition, the quality of predictions is higher in industrial areas. From a temporal point of view, the LSTM-DRSL framework is more suitable for hourly predictions.</p>},

   abstract = {While previous works have shown that machine learning (ML) can improve the
prediction accuracy of coarse-grid climate models, these ML-augmented methods
are more vulnerable to irregular inputs than the traditional physics-based
models they rely on. Because ML-predicted corrections feed back into the
climate model's base physics, the ML-corrected model regularly produces out of
sample data, which can cause model instability and frequent crashes. This work
shows that adding semi-supervised novelty detection to identify out-of-sample
data and disable the ML-correction accordingly stabilizes simulations and
sharply improves the quality of predictions. We design an augmented climate
model with a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) novelty detector that
provides better temperature and precipitation forecasts in a year-long
simulation than either a baseline (no-ML) or a standard ML-corrected run. By
improving the accuracy of coarse-grid climate models, this work helps make
accurate climate models accessible to researchers without massive computational
resources.},

   abstract = {<p><![CDATA[Abstract. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models solve a system of partial differential equations based on physical laws to forecast the future state of the atmosphere. These models are deployed operationally, but they are computationally very expensive. Recently, the potential of deep neural networks to generate bespoke weather forecasts has been explored in a couple of scientific studies inspired by the success of video frame prediction models in computer vision. In this study, a simple recurrent neural network with convolutional filters, called ConvLSTM, and an advanced generative network, the Stochastic Adversarial Video Prediction (SAVP) model, are applied to create hourly forecasts of the 2âmÂ temperature for the nextÂ 12âh over Europe. We make use of 13Â years of data from the ERA5 reanalysis, of which 11Â years are utilized for training and 1Â year each is used for validating and testing. We choose the 2âmÂ temperature, total cloud cover, and the 850âhPaÂ temperature as predictors and show that both models attain predictive skill by outperforming persistence forecasts. SAVP is superior to ConvLSTM in terms of several evaluation metrics, confirming previous results from computer vision that larger, more complex networks are better suited to learn complex features and to generate better predictions. The 12âh forecasts of SAVP attain a mean squared error (MSE) of about 2.3âK2, an anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) larger than 0.85, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of aroundÂ 0.72, and a gradient ratio (rG) of aboutÂ 0.82. The ConvLSTM yields a higher MSE (3.6âK2), a smaller ACC (0.80) and SSIM (0.65), and a slightly larger rG (0.84). The superior performance of SAVP in terms of MSE, ACC, and SSIM can be largely attributed to the generator. A sensitivity study shows that a larger weight of the generative adversarial network (GAN) component in the SAVP loss leads to even better preservation of spatial variability at the cost of a somewhat increased MSE (2.5âK2). Including the 850âhPaÂ temperature as an additional predictor enhances the forecast quality, and the model also benefits from a larger spatial domain. By contrast, adding the total cloud cover as predictor or reducing the amount of training data to 8Â years has only small effects. Although the temperature forecasts obtained in this way are still less powerful than contemporary NWP models, this study demonstrates that sophisticated deep neural networks may achieve considerable forecast quality beyond the nowcasting range in a purely data-driven way.]]></p>},

   abstract = {<p>Atmospheric air temperature is the most crucial metrological parameter. Despite its influence on multiple fields such as hydrology, the environment, irrigation, and agriculture, this parameter describes climate change and global warming quite well. Thus, accurate and timely air temperature forecasting is essential because it provides more important information that can be relied on for future planning. In this study, four Data-Driven Approaches, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree (RT), Quantile Regression Tree (QRT), ARIMA, Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), have been applied to forecast short-, and mid-term air temperature (daily, and weekly) over North America under continental climatic conditions. The time-series data is relatively long (2000 to 2021), 70% of the data are used for model calibration (2000 to 2015), and the rest are used for validation. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions have been used to select the best input combination for the forecasting models. The quality of predicting models is evaluated using several statistical measures and graphical comparisons. For daily scale, the SVR has generated more accurate estimates than other models, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 3.592Â°C), Correlation Coefficient (R = 0.964), Mean Absolute Error (MAE = 2.745Â°C), and Thielsâ U-statistics (U = 0.127). Besides, the study found that both RT and SVR performed very well in predicting weekly temperature. This study discovered that the duration of the employed data and its dispersion and volatility from month to month substantially influence the predictive modelsâ efficacy. Furthermore, the second scenario is conducted using the randomization method to divide the data into training and testing phases. The study found the performance of the models in the second scenario to be much better than the first one, indicating that climate change affects the temperature pattern of the studied station. The findings offered technical support for generating high-resolution daily and weekly temperature forecasts using Data-Driven Methodologies.</p>},
